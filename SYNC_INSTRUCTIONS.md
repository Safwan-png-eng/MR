# How to Sync Character Images Added via GitHub ðŸ”„

When you add WebP images directly through GitHub (not through the upload interface), they won't automatically appear in your app until you sync them.

## Quick Sync Methods

### Method 1: Use the Sync Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run sync-characters
```

This will:
- âœ… Scan for all WebP files in `public/characters/images/`
- âœ… Add them to the configuration
- âœ… Set a default character if none exists
- âœ… Show you a summary of what was synced

### Method 2: Use the Sync Button in the App
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `/characters` in your browser
3. Click the "Sync" button in the top-right corner of the upload card
4. Your images will be synced and appear immediately

### Method 3: Automatic Sync on Page Load
- Simply visit `/characters` in your app
- The sync will run automatically when the page loads
- Check the browser console for sync confirmation

## Adding Images via GitHub

1. **Upload your WebP files** to the `public/characters/images/` folder via GitHub
2. **Run sync** using one of the methods above
3. **Visit `/characters`** to see your images and set a default

## File Requirements

- âœ… **Format**: WebP only (`.webp` extension)
- âœ… **Size**: Maximum 10MB per file
- âœ… **Location**: Must be in `public/characters/images/` folder
- âœ… **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `hero-portrait.webp`

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Add images via GitHub to public/characters/images/
# 2. Pull the changes locally (or run on server)
git pull

# 3. Sync the images
npm run sync-characters

# 4. Start your app
npm run dev

# 5. Visit /characters to see your images
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images not appearing after sync?
- Check file format is `.webp`
- Verify files are in `public/characters/images/` folder
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Sync script fails?
- Make sure you're in the project root directory
- Check file permissions on the characters folder
- Verify Node.js is installed and working

### Default character not set?
- The first image found will automatically become default
- You can change the default by clicking the star icon in the app
- Or manually edit `public/characters/defaults/characters.json`

**Pro Tip**: After adding images via GitHub, always run `npm run sync-characters` to ensure they appear in your app! ðŸš€
