# Character Images System - Setup Complete! 🎭

Your WebP character images system has been successfully set up and is ready to use.

## What's Been Created

### 📁 Directory Structure
```
public/characters/
├── images/           # Your WebP character images go here
├── defaults/         # Configuration files (auto-generated)
│   └── characters.json
└── README.md         # Documentation
```

### 🔧 Backend Components
- **`lib/character-images.ts`** - Core utilities for managing character images
- **`lib/startup.ts`** - Automatic initialization on app start
- **`app/api/characters/upload/route.ts`** - Upload API endpoint
- **`app/api/characters/default/route.ts`** - Default character management API

### 🎨 Frontend Components
- **`components/character-upload.tsx`** - React component for uploading and managing images
- **`app/characters/page.tsx`** - Dedicated page at `/characters`

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Upload Interface
Visit `/characters` in your application to access the character upload interface.

### 2. Upload WebP Images
- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag your WebP files onto the upload area
- **Click to Select**: Click the upload area to open file browser
- **Multiple Files**: Upload multiple images at once
- **File Validation**: Only WebP files under 10MB are accepted

### 3. Set Default Character
- Click the star icon on any character to set it as default
- The default character will be remembered after restart
- Only one character can be default at a time

### 4. Automatic Sync
- Images are automatically synced when the app starts
- New images added directly to `public/characters/images/` will be detected
- Configuration is saved in `public/characters/defaults/characters.json`

## API Endpoints

### Upload Images
```
POST /api/characters/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: FormData with 'file' field
```

### Get All Characters

## File Naming Convention

For best results, use descriptive filenames:
- `character-name.webp`
- `hero-portrait.webp`
- `villain-full-body.webp`

## Persistence Features

✅ **Images persist after restart** - Stored in `public/characters/images/`
✅ **Default character persists** - Saved in configuration file
✅ **Automatic sync on startup** - No manual intervention needed
✅ **Git tracking** - Images are included in version control
✅ **File validation** - Only WebP files accepted
✅ **Size limits** - Maximum 10MB per file

## Example Usage in Code

```typescript
import { getDefaultCharacter, getCharacterImages } from '@/lib/character-images';

// Get the default character
const defaultChar = await getDefaultCharacter();

// Get all characters
const allCharacters = await getCharacterImages();

// Use in component
<img src={defaultChar?.path} alt={defaultChar?.name} />
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images not showing after upload
1. Check file format is WebP
2. Verify file size is under 10MB
3. Check browser console for errors

### Default character not persisting
1. Ensure `public/characters/defaults/` directory is writable
2. Check that `characters.json` is being created
3. Verify startup tasks are running

### Upload fails
1. Check file permissions on `public/characters/images/`
2. Verify disk space is available
3. Check network connectivity
